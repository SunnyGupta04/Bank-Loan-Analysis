# Bank-Loan-Analysis

Agenda:  To gain a thorough understanding of our lending operations and track loan performance, I designed a grid view report segmented by 'Loan Status.' This report provides valuable insights into key metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Repaid,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Repaid,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio.' By delivering these metrics, this report enables data-driven decision-making and helps assess the overall health of our loan portfolio.
